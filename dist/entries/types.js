/**
 * @fileoverview Types subpath barrel — `stellar-drive/types`
 *
 * Aggregates all public TypeScript type exports from the stellar-drive package
 * into a single, convenient entry point. Consumers can import any type from
 * this path without needing to know the internal module structure.
 *
 * No runtime code is emitted from this file — it contains only `export type`
 * statements and will be fully erased during compilation.
